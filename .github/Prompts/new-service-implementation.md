# RAG Implementation Guide for Technical Documentation Assistant

This guide outlines the steps needed to implement a new RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) feature in the Technical Documentation Assistant solution. Use this as a checklist and reference for adding any new RAG component or service.

---

## 0. Determine RAG Component Type
- Is this a **Document Processing** component (handles ingestion, chunking, embedding generation)?
  - Place models under `TechnicalDocsAssistant.Core/Models/` and services under `TechnicalDocsAssistant.Infrastructure/Services/`.
- Is this an **Asset Management** component (manages technical artifacts, user stories, or other RAG assets)?
  - Place models under `TechnicalDocsAssistant.Core/Models/` and services under `TechnicalDocsAssistant.Infrastructure/Services/`.
- Is this a **Chat/Retrieval** component (handles queries, retrieval, and generation)?
  - Place models under `TechnicalDocsAssistant.Core/Models/Chat/` and services under `TechnicalDocsAssistant.Infrastructure/Services/`.

## 1. Core Models and Interfaces
- [ ] Add new models to `TechnicalDocsAssistant.Core/Models/`.
- [ ] Create interfaces in `TechnicalDocsAssistant.Core/Interfaces/`.
- [ ] Add DTOs in `TechnicalDocsAssistant.Core/DTOs/` if needed.
- [ ] Document model properties, relationships, and validation requirements.
- [ ] Ensure models implement proper interfaces and follow nullable reference patterns.

## 2. Infrastructure Implementation
- [ ] Implement service classes in `TechnicalDocsAssistant.Infrastructure/Services/`.
- [ ] Add data access components in `TechnicalDocsAssistant.Infrastructure/Data/` if needed.
- [ ] Use async/await patterns throughout.
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging.
- [ ] Add Supabase integration for vector storage if needed.
- [ ] Implement OpenAI or other LLM provider integration if required.
- [ ] Add unit tests for service logic.

## 3. API Integration
- [ ] Add new controller in `TechnicalDocsAssistant.API/Controllers/`.
- [ ] Implement proper route attributes and HTTP method handlers.
- [ ] Add input validation and error handling.
- [ ] Document API endpoints with XML comments for Swagger.
- [ ] Register services in [Program.cs](cci:7://file:///c:/Code/Work/RAGArtifacts/TechnicalDocsAssistant/src/TechnicalDocsAssistant.API/Program.cs:0:0-0:0) using dependency injection.
- [ ] Update configuration in [appsettings.json](cci:7://file:///c:/Code/Work/RAGArtifacts/TechnicalDocsAssistant/src/TechnicalDocsAssistant.API/appsettings.json:0:0-0:0) and [appsettings.Development.json](cci:7://file:///c:/Code/Work/RAGArtifacts/TechnicalDocsAssistant/src/TechnicalDocsAssistant.API/appsettings.Development.json:0:0-0:0).

## 4. Semantic Kernel Plugin Integration (if needed)
- [ ] Add new plugin in `TechnicalDocsAssistant.SKPlugins/`.
- [ ] Implement semantic functions with proper prompts and configuration.
- [ ] Register plugin in the API's [Program.cs](cci:7://file:///c:/Code/Work/RAGArtifacts/TechnicalDocsAssistant/src/TechnicalDocsAssistant.API/Program.cs:0:0-0:0).

## 5. Web Application Components
### 5.1 API Client
- [ ] Add API client in `technical-docs-web/src/api/`.
- [ ] Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for request/response models.
- [ ] Add error handling and loading states.

### 5.2 UI Components
- [ ] Create React components in `technical-docs-web/src/components/`.
- [ ] Add styles using Tailwind CSS.
- [ ] Implement responsive design principles.
- [ ] Add proper loading states and error handling.

### 5.3 Pages and Routing
- [ ] Add or update pages in `technical-docs-web/src/app/`.
- [ ] Configure routing in Next.js.
- [ ] Implement proper state management using React hooks or context.

### 5.4 Integration
- [ ] Connect frontend components to API clients.
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries and fallbacks.
- [ ] Add authentication integration with Supabase if needed.

## 6. Vector Database Setup
- [ ] Update Supabase schema with new tables or vector columns.
- [ ] Configure proper indexes for vector similarity search.
- [ ] Add migration scripts if needed.
- [ ] Document schema changes and vector dimensions.

## 7. Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for core models and services.
- [ ] Add integration tests for API endpoints.
- [ ] Add UI component tests if applicable.
- [ ] Test vector search performance with realistic data volumes.

## 8. Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation with new endpoints.
- [ ] Add usage examples and sample requests/responses.
- [ ] Update diagrams to reflect new components.
- [ ] Document configuration requirements.

## 9. Infrastructure and Deployment
- [ ] Update container configuration if needed.
- [ ] Configure proper environment variables.
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipeline if applicable.
- [ ] Document resource requirements.

## 10. Security
- [ ] Implement proper authentication and authorization.
- [ ] Validate all user inputs.
- [ ] Secure API keys and sensitive configuration.
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all communications.

## Best Practices Checklist
- [ ] Follow async/await patterns throughout
- [ ] Use nullable reference types properly
- [ ] Implement proper disposal patterns for resources
- [ ] Follow consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Use dependency injection for all services
- [ ] Keep components small and focused
- [ ] Use proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Follow SOLID principles
- [ ] Ensure code reusability
- [ ] Maintain separation of concerns
- [ ] Use proper vector dimensions for embeddings (1536 for OpenAI)
- [ ] Implement proper chunking strategies for documents
- [ ] Use efficient vector search techniques

## Performance Considerations
- [ ] Optimize vector search with proper indexes
- [ ] Implement caching where appropriate
- [ ] Monitor token usage for LLM calls
- [ ] Optimize document chunking for retrieval relevance
- [ ] Consider batch processing for large document sets
- [ ] Implement proper pagination for large result sets
- [ ] Monitor and optimize embedding generation performance

## Supabase Integration
