# Application Masterplan: AI-Powered Technical Documentation Assistant

## Overview
A web-based application that helps engineers create technical artifacts from user stories and provides intelligent querying capabilities for technical documentation. The system uses Semantic Kernel for AI orchestration and supports both artifact generation and documentation querying modes.

## Core Objectives
- Generate accurate technical artifacts (flow charts, sequence diagrams, test cases) from structured user stories
- Enable intelligent querying of technical documentation using RAG
- Provide intuitive editing and sharing capabilities for generated artifacts
- Build a knowledge base of frequently asked questions and their answers

## Target Audience
- Software Engineers
- Technical Writers
- System Architects
- Project Managers

## Technical Stack
### Backend
- .NET Core Web API
- Semantic Kernel for AI orchestration
- PlantUML for diagram generation
- Supabase for data persistence
- Vector database for RAG implementation (e.g., pgvector in Supabase)

### Frontend
- Next.js for web application
- Shadcn for UI components
- Split-view editor for PlantUML
- PDF/PNG export capabilities

## Core Features

### 1. Artifact Generation
- Input structured user stories with predefined fields
- Generate flow charts with main and alternative flows
- Support swim lanes for actor separation
- Preview generated artifacts before saving
- Edit artifacts in split-view mode
- Export to PlantUML, PNG, and PDF formats
- Maintain traceability between user stories and artifacts

### 2. RAG Implementation
- Process and index markdown documentation
- Support cross-document querying
- Show source sections alongside generated answers
- Save and manage frequently asked questions
- Implement caching for improved performance
- Maintain relationships between documents

### 3. User Interaction
- Share artifacts via generated links
- Rate and comment on generated artifacts and RAG responses
- Edit generated artifacts in real-time
- Preview changes before saving

- Create test case generation

## Security Considerations
- Implement secure sharing mechanisms
- Sanitize user inputs
- Secure API endpoints
- Implement rate limiting
- Manage file upload security

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Accuracy of Generated Artifacts
Solution: 
- Implement validation rules for generated content
- Allow user editing and feedback
- Continuously improve generation prompts based on feedback

### Challenge 2: RAG Performance
Solution:
- Implement efficient caching
- Optimize vector search
- Use chunking strategies for large documents

### Challenge 3: PlantUML Integration
Solution:
- Use server-side rendering for PlantUML
- Implement client-side caching of rendered diagrams
- Optimize update frequency in split-view

## Future Expansion Possibilities
